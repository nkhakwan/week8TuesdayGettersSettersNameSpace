## Description

_This was just a C# coding practice day. Tried to write C# code without looking at the lessons. Got accustomed to Class and constructore Syntax along with how to generate lists that contains Constructors. Also got practice today for namespace, getters and setters.This project has different sets of UI and backend code. This was just for practice. The one that currently is effective just puts out a name and than in the coding it uses a setter to change the name and output the differnt name_
